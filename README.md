# Problem set solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Problem Set 2019 for the module Programming and Scripting at GMIT.

{See here for the instructions}(https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/problems-pands-2019/raw/master/problems.pdf)

## How to download this repository

1.  Go to Github.
2.  Click the download button.

##  How to run the code

1. Make sure to have Python installed.
2. Change directory until you are in the correct one.
3. On the command line type Python followed by the name of the file whose script you wish to run.  Make sure to enter .py at the end.


## What each file contains

1.  sumupto.py contains my solution to problem 1 in the problem set.
2.  begins-with-t.py contains my solution to problem 2 in the problem set.
3.  pythondivisory.py contains my solution to problem 3 in the problem set.
4.  collatz.py contains my solution to problem 4 in the problem set.  
5.  primes.py contains my solution to problem 5 in the problem set.
6.  secondstring.py contains my solution to problem 6 in the problem set.
7.  squareroot.py contains my solution to problem 7 in the problem set.
8.  solution8.py contains my solution to problem 8 in the problem set.  I ran into an issue with the naming convention on this one.  I had an          issue with problem 2 as I originally saved problem 8 as datetime.py. When I went to run problem 2 (which also imports date time), it tried to      import the results of this file which caused an error message so I amended the title of the problem to the number.  
9.  second.py and moby-dick.txt contains my solution to problem 9 in the problem set.
10. plot.py contains my solution to problem 10 in the problem set.
